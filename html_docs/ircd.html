3) Modifing the Header File<br />
4) The Code<br />
5) Modes<br />
6) Functions / Events<br />
7) Last part of setup<br />
<br />
============================================================================<br />
<br />
1) Introduction<br />
<br />
Creating an IRCD Module for Denora is rather simple, however it does 
require knowledge of both C language, the IRCD protocol. The base API is 
described below, it is meant to guide through the basics of creating IRCD 
Modules. Since IRCD Protocols are complex and very hard to understand, this 
documentent is not meant to solve these problems just explain how the 
framework functions.<br />
<br />
Denora supports TSora v3, v5 and v6 (TS3, TS5, TS6), and P10 (ircu)
protocols. This cover the majority of the current and past ircds. Should
your ircd not fit within these types please contact the Denora Dev team
to see about supporting your protocol.<br />
<br />
============================================================================<br />
<br />
2) Preparing to add new IRCD<br />
<br />
    In preparing to add an IRCD module to Denora, first you will want to be
    on the most current GIT version of Denora, to ensure that you are using
    the most current code base, as changes are frequent its best to have the
    most current.<br />
<br />
    Before going to far its best to look in toe src/protocol folder and 
    locate the ircd which most closely matches the ircd that you want to add
    support for. Make a copy of the .c and .h file from the src/protocol and 
    name them after the ircd that you are adding. For this example we will be 
    making an ircd called "quakeircd" (http://sourceforge.net/projects/quakeircd/)<br />
<br />
    A) So we would rename the unreal32.c and unreal32.h to be quakeircd.c and
       quakeircd.h <br />
<br />
    B) In the sql/ folder there is a sql table file for the ircd, again we will
       take unreal32.sql and rename it to be quakeircd.sql<br />
<br />
    C) To ensure your module builds on Windows. Open src/protocol/Makefile.win32
       and in the SRCS= section append the ircd name set in step A.<br />
<br />
    You are now ready to start getting into the code.<br />
<br />
============================================================================<br />
<br />
<br />
3) Modifying the Header File<br />
<br />
    Now that you have gotten past the first part of the creation process, you
    are into the code. This part is the harder and more complex part. You
    will need a general understanding of C code to continue. Here are the
    step by step instructions required to make this work.<br />
<br />
    Open the .h file and find the section of code with the User Modes these
    are a series of UMODE_ based on the letter of the mode, starting with
    the hex of 0x00000001, add each User mode that with a UMODE_ up to the
    hex of 0x80000000, do not overlap the modes.<br />
<br />
    Do the same with CMODE_ this is the channel modes that Denora will know
    about, do not include +o (oper), +v (voice), +h (halfop), +q (owner),
    +a (admin).<br />
<br />
    Next there are a series of _cmd_ these are the base commands you must have
    these in your .c file this will be covered in the next section you will 
    want to name the first part of the function after your ircd. In our case
    we are going to rename unreal_cmd_eob(); to be quakeircd_cmd_eob();<br />
<br />
    Lastly you need may want to strip down the _event_ functions, or leave them 
    alone till later till you find any events functions that you are not using.
    You can also add more events as you feel you need to make the file 100%
    complaint with the ircd<br />
<br />
============================================================================<br />
<br />
4) The Code<br />
<br />
    Here is where the code of the .c file comes in. Be prepared to spend at
    least an hour, if not longer, going over the code and getting it right;
    Especially if you are setting up an ircd that is completely different
    than the one you used as a base. This section covers the majority of the
    code that is in use. <br />
<br />
    The first bit of code you will face is:<br />
<br />
     #include "quakeircd.h"<br />
<br />
    You need to include the .h file that you are building with. This is very
    important.<br />
<br />
    Now you've come to the part where you setup your ircd. There are two
    structs which hold this information; This allows you to quickly setup
    your specific ircd.<br />
<br />
        IRCDVar myircd[] = { }<br />
<br />
    This struct contains your basic IRCd functions. Your base source file has
    the list of all available variables; note that you should not swap any
    around, or you will break stuff. Here is a brief description of the usage
    of each.<br />
<br />
    1) Name: This member tells Denora about the IRCD's name. It may contain
             text about it's name and version. This is used to identify the
             build on startup.<br />
<br />
    2) StatServ Mode: This is the user mode set by Denora on StatServ.
                      Normally you want this to be some form of oper flag,
                      or a services flag. <br />
<br />
    3) VHOST: Can a user's host be changed on the fly? Enabling this allow
               HostServ online. Use 1 for yes, 0 for no.<br />
<br />
    4) SGLINE: Does the IRCd support realname (geocs) bans? Use 1 for yes,
               0 for no. <br />
<br />
    5) SGLINE TABLE : If yes to #4 does the IRCD send the SGLINE as its own 
                      ban (1 yes), or as part of the general Glines (0 no).<br />
<br />
    6) SQLINE: Does the IRCd support nick bans? Use 1 for yes, 0 for no.<br />
<br />
    7) SQLINE TABLE: If yes to #4 does the IRCD send the SQLINE as its own 
                     ban (1 yes), or as part of the general Glines (0 no).<br />
<br />
    8) SZLINE: Does the IRCd support SZLINES? Use 1 for yes, 0 for no.<br />
<br />
    9) Exceptions: Support for channel exceptions (mode +e). Use 1 for yes,<br />
                    0 for no.<br />
<br />
    10) vIdent: Support for including a user's ident in their vHost. Use
                1 for yes, 0 for no.<br />
<br />
    11) Vhost On Nick: On NICK the IRCd sends the VHOST. Use 1 for yes,
                       0 for no.<br />
<br />
    12) NICKIP: The IP address of new users is being sent along with their
                hostname when new users are being introduced on the network.
                Use 1 for yes, 0 for no.<br />
<br />
    13) Flood Mode: The IRCd has a channelmode for blocking floods. Use 1 for
                    yes, 0 for no.<br />
<br />
    14) Link Mode: The IRCd has a channelmode for linking a channel to some
                   other channel. Use 1 for yes, 0 for no.<br />
<br />
    15) CMode F: CMODE_ that defines flood mode. Use 0 for no support.<br />
<br />
    16) CMode L: CMODE_ that defines link mode. Use 0 for no support.<br />
<br />
    17) Tokens: Can we use tokens to talk to the IRCd? Use 1 for yes,
                0 for no.<br />
<br />
    18) Token Case Senstive: Are the IRCd's TOKENS/COMMANDS case sensitive?
                             Use 1 for yes, 0 for no.<br />
<br />
    19) base64 SJOIN TS: Are the timestamps sent with a SJOIN in base64? Use
                         1 for yes, 0 for no.<br />
<br />
    20) Supports +I: Does the IRCd support channelmode +I? Use 1 for yes,
                     0 for no.<br />
<br />
    21) SJOIN Ban Char: Character used to identify bans. Use ''.<br />
<br />
    22) SJOIN Except Char: Character used to identify exceptions. use ''.<br />
<br />

                     Use 0 for no support.<br />
<br />
    24) Owner: Is channel mode +q for owner supported by the IRCd? Use 1 for
                yes, 0 for no.<br />
<br />
    25) PROTECT: Is channel mode +a for protect/admin supported by the IRCd? Use 1 for
                yes, 0 for no.<br />
<br />
    26) HALFOP: Is channel mode +h for halfop supported by the IRCd? Use 1 for
                yes, 0 for no.<br />
<br />
    27) Flood Mode Character: The character used to represent the channel flood mode, 
                              if this is supported by the IRCd.<br />
<br />
    28) Alt Flood Mode Character: The alternative character used to represent the channel 
                                  flood mode, if this is supported by the IRCd.<br />
<br />
    30) Vhost Character: The character used to represent the vHost mode, if
                         this is supported by the IRCd.<br />
<br />
    31) Alt Vhost Character: The alternative character used to represent the vHost mode,

                  Use 1 for yes, 0 for no.<br />
<br />
    35) Gagged : Has a channel mode that prevents the user from taking but the
                 user is not banned.<br />
<br />
    36) Spamfilters : Some ircds have a spam filter ban system, set to be either
        IRCD_ENABLE, IRCD_DISABLE<br />
<br />
    37) Ban mode character: typically "b" on most IRCD but if yours is different

<br />
    42) uline : whether ircd supports ulining servers for services
        IRCD_ENABLE, IRCD_DISABLE<br />
<br />
    43) nickchar : Some ircds can set their allowed character strings, if there is one
        list it here, if you don't know use NULL<br />
<br />
    44) svid : whether ircd supports svid<br />

<br />
<br />
    So we've had this long list. Now there's a second struct to fill. This
    struct isn't as long as the previous one though, so we'll handle it quite
    quick compared to the previous one.<br />
<br />
        IRCDCAPAB ircdcap[] = { }<br />
<br />
    This struct is based on the CAPAB defines. You should review the CAPAB
    table below to see how this should be done.<br />

<br />
============================================================================<br />
<br />
5) Modes <br />
<br />
	Find the section of code for the following<br />
<br />
	void IRCDModeInit(void)<br />
	{<br />
	}<br />
<br />
	Add in user modes simple call the function<br />
<br />
		ModuleSetUserMode(UMODE_A, IRCD_ENABLE);<br />
<br />
	All letters for UMODE_* are defined so have no fear, and you can set
	the default is IRCD_ENABLE<br />
<br />
<br />
	For Channel modes we have two types, modes that are bans and modes that restrict channel actions.
	Both functions act the same<br />
<br />
		CreateChanBanMode(CMODE_b, add_ban, del_ban);<br />
<br />
		CreateChanMode(CMODE_j, set_flood_alt, get_flood_alt);<br />
<br />
	First paramater is the mode, like UMODE_* all the CMODE_* are defined
        Second parameter is what to do when the IRCD sets the mode if anything, if nothing set to NULL
        Third parameter is what do when the IRCD unsets the mode, if nothing set to NULL<br />
<br />
	At the end of this function you need to call<br />
<br />
	ModuleUpdateSQLUserMode();<br />
	ModuleUpdateSQLChanMode();<br />
<br />
	These sets up SQL for the various modes your IRCD supports<br />
<br />
============================================================================<br />
<br />
6) Functions and Events<br />
<br />
    A brief word about functions and events. There is more detail below on
    what events should pass their information to along with what is passed
    to each Command function. All events are captured using:<br />
<br />
        void moduleAddIRCDMsgs(void)<br />
        {<br />
            m = createMessage("NICK", denora_event_nick); <br />
            addCoreMessage(IRCD,m);<br />
        }<br />
<br />
    Each event should have a event handler if its important enough to be
    processed by services. All event functions should be formed like this:<br />
<br />
        int Denora_event_capab(char *source, int ac, char **av)<br />
        {<br />
            return MOD_CONT;<br />
        }<br />
<br />
    They will receive the source; this can be NULL at times depending on the
    event. Next, ac is the number of arguments that are in the event, and av
    holds the values for each; so av[0] is the first variable, av[1] will be
    the second one, and so on. Events are likely to pass to various upper
    level event handlers; see the previous ircd source for how they handle
    these events.<br />
<br />
    All commands are formed like this:<br />
<br />
        void quakeircd_cmd_join(char *user, char *channel, time_t chantime)<br />
        {<br />
         send_cmd(ServerName, "%s !%s %s :%s",<br />
             send_token("SJOIN", "~"), base64enc((long int) chantime),<br />
             channel, user);<br />
        }<br />
<br />
    They may take any number of arguments, depending on the command. They
    should eventually come to a send_cmd(); this root function is how
    commands are sent to the IRCd.<br />
<br />
       The Commands are setup in the function<br />
<br />
       void moduleAddIRCDCmds() <br />
        {<br />
         pmodule_cmd_join(quakeircd_cmd_join);<br />
        }<br /><br />
    each of the core command functions has a pmodule_cmd which takes the
    information out of the module and allows the core to use it. Remember 
    you must have the core set of commands in your module. Even if you
    have to put in<br />
<br />
        void quakeircd_cmd_pass(char *pass)<br />
        {<br />
        /* not used */<br />
        }<br />
<br />
============================================================================<br />
<br />
7) The last part of Setup<br />
<br />
Once you have completed the task of setting up Commands and Events you
come to the last bit of code that needs to be dealt with and that is the init
function of your IRCD Module. The DenoraInit has some key variables setup<br />
<br />
    moduleAddAuthor("Denora");<br />
    moduleAddVersion("");<br />
    moduleSetType(PROTOCOL);<br />
    pmodule_ircd_version("QuakeIRCD");<br />
    pmodule_ircd_cap(myIrcdcap);<br />
    pmodule_ircd_var(myIrcd);<br />
    pmodule_ircd_useTSMode(0);<br />
    pmodule_oper_umode(UMODE_o);<br />
    pmodule_ircd_cbmodeinfos(myCbmodeinfos);<br />
    pmodule_ircd_cbmodes(myCbmodes);<br />
    pmodule_ircd_cmmodes(myCmmodes);<br />
    pmodule_ircd_csmodes(myCsmodes);<br />
    pmodule_ircd_umodes(myumodes);<br />
    moduleAddIRCDCmds();<br />
    moduleAddIRCDMsgs();<br />
<br />
<br />
moduleAddAuthor, allows you to set your name as the author of the module
this is displayed when viewing the module list.<br />
<br />
moduleAddVersion, we recommend setting this to  when impoted to our
svn it will get the above formatted version, this is best for debugging 
problems that might come up<br />
<br />
moduleSetType, you must set this to PROTOCOL as it tells Denora that you
are loading in a IRCD Module.<br />
<br />
pmodule_ircd_version : sets up the IRC Protocol display that is shown to
the user as they load your module<br />
<br />
pmodule_ircd_cap : setup the capab variables, you should pass the ircdcap
variable struct to this function so it can be passed up to the core<br />
<br />
pmodule_ircd_var : setup the ircd variables, you should pass the ircd
variable struct to this function so it can be passed up to the core<br />
<br />
pmodule_ircd_useTSMode : Should your ircd send time stamped modes but not
